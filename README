programmer:
  -- gives the framework a DOM tree
    * nodes w/ a "source" property are atomic w.r.t. to editing,
      the framework never looks inside them.
      -- backspace deletes whole thing, all at once
      -- this is useful for doing decoration stuff (source = '')
      -- also useful for representing keywords as graphics (ST-like up-arrow image would have source = 'return')
    * text nodes are fine, and allow cursor and editing operations inside

framework:
  -- converts programmer-provided DOM to a string
  -- keeps track of cursor position
  -- displays cursor
  -- processes user events (keyboard and pointer events)
    * mutates user-provided DOM when key press events happen
      (but also asks programmer for a new DOM using updated string)
